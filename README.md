# Game of Life

A neat lab which demonstrates how to use D3 to build Conway's Game of Life. A simple simulation of cells on a grid which obey a few simple rules to produce complex patterns.

## Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
